Vector space model or term vector model is an algebraic model for representing text documents (or more generally, items) as vectors such that the distance between vectors represents the relevance between the documents. It is used in information filtering, information retrieval, indexing and relevancy rankings. Its first use was in the SMART Information Retrieval System.
